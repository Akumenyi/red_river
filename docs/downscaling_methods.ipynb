    "# Downscaling Methods\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a variation of the constructed analogs method described by ([Pierce et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1)) to downscale CMIP5 projections for the Red River, Vietnam. Our modified method is termed **Constructed Analogs with Single Anomaly Analog (CASAA)**. Key differences from ([Pierce et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1)) include:\n",
    "* We use anomalies for downscaling both temperature and precipitation. In contrast, ([Pierce et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1)) use anomalies for downscaling temperature and absolute values for downscaling precipitation. We found that anomalies provided better performance when downscaling precipitation and helped to avoid instability issues with the scaling factor described in section 3.b.4 and Appendix d of ([Pierce et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1)). Because we use anomalies, our precipitation scaling factor is additive instead of multiplicative.\n",
    "* For a specific chosen analog, we preserve the high-resolution wet-dry spatial pattern. Unlike ([Pierce et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1)), we make sure the applied scaling factor (section 3.b.4 and Appendix d) does not change any high-resolution grid cells from wet to dry in the high-resolution analog.\n",
    "* We do not use the localized analog selection procedure of ([Pierce et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1)). We select a best match analog for a specific day using the entire Red River spatial domain. \n",
